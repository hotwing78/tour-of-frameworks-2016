# Tour of Frameworks - Dec 2016

This December, I wanted to revisit the tour of frameworks. I did the original
tour 6 months ago and a lot has changed. I should do this tour every 6 months as
fast as things change.

In this tour, I will build a simple master detail app, the will be a basic
project/task app.

## Mad Science Tracker

The mad science tracker is a project/task application that will track all of
my mad science projects and provide a dashboard to show all the projects and
the current status of each along with a project name and logo.

As the admin, you will be able to manage projects and set the status of each
project. Within each project you will be able to manage tasks and set the
state or status of each task.
